This is my OAuth2/.NET MVC solution. 

What needs to be done is for you to visit: http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/oauth2/ to get setup the OAuth2 for MailChimp.

What you then need to do is find in the Controllers/HomeController.cs the section at the top where you fill in your configuration.

This should be able to be used with other OAuth sites, although not fully tested. 

As of now, after putting in your information, by visiting the index page you will be asked to Authorize yourself. After that, you will sign into MailChimp and then the top 5 mail lists will be shown. You can then click on a mailing list to view activity on that mailing list.

#TODO

Implement more API functions.
